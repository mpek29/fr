Ant Uprising: The Underground War is a little 2D game I made with a team of colleagues from my engineering school during the Global Game Jam 2023. In this game, you play as an ant in a root-covered anthill (the theme of the Jam was "Root"). Your aim is to collect a few fruits to feed your queen. But beware, there are enemies out to stop you.
